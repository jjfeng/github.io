I am an incoming Assistant Professor In-Residence in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of California, San Francisco. I completed my Ph.D. in Biostatistics under [Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) at the University of Washington. Before that, I studied computer science at Stanford and was a software engineer at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) for a few years.
